There was not much going on within the module, aside from a small discussion about how light affects an objects color. This module was more a set up. There was one thing that was interesting though, involving the use of multiple shaders for the first time. With the use of two shaders, you do have to set the uniforms after every shader swap, which was surprising to me, however its apparent that a game could be using thousands of shaders, to which they likely need to hold all the uniforms in temporary memory. Looking up the location of where uniforms are stored, I see that there something called a Uniform Buffer Object, which is probably worth looking in to. Another thing that was interesting and should probably intuitive but wasn't, was the fact that I didn't have to swap out the VAO while changing shaders. I feel like I've been so accustomed to all the data being one large clump, but I should know that a lot of aspects are modular.

A large chunk of todays work was debugging the camera library, as there was an extremely bothersome camera jitter on first click. It was a long windy process, but to jump straight to the end, there wasn't anything wrong with the implementation, but just the starting values of pitch and yaw. I wanted the camera to look at origin in world space and start there, but the camera kept snapping to the positive x axis direction. To put it short, I had intialized yaw to 0.0f, which translated to looking in that direction. Our starting camera's POV based on our input meant that yaw actually was initialized to -90.0f, which then upon mouse input, cause the code to run that set yaw to 0.0f and forcibly snap to that angle.

There is another issue thats really bothering me, being that the cursor does not disappear when you interact with the OpenGL window. It seems like a minor issue, however all posts lead to saying that the function to take mouse input should also automatically make the cursor hidden as well, depending on the parameter. I could probably look into the actual library and dig for the correct function, however that minor issue probably should deter myself from more pressing matters like lighting.
