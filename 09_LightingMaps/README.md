This module featured using textures as the ambience and diffusion rather than colors. The intended color is already a part of the texture itself, however I image that you are able to still have a separate vec3 for both ambience and diffusion if wanted. This module in itself was rather short as well, and this was more or less a continuation to the previous module Phong, and thus context from there is needed. A more isolated topic introduced though was emission maps, which is implemented in a similar manner, however since the intended use of these maps is to be independent of the light, we don't modify it with the use of light ambience, diffuse, or specular.

I just wanted to note, that from the previous module, I had questioned as to why we needed two ambience, diffuse, and specular values, and concluded that it was because it was in the case of if we wanted to mix to light colors together, which sure it's an application, but this module did clear up as to why, being that the light values and are set by the light source shader, why the materials shader is for the appearance of the shader. It's pretty clear now for its purpose, but just wasn't at first.
