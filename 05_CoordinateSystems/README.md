Coordinate systems were something that I was already partially familiar with due to skimming a graphics programming textbook, as such similar to the previous module this felt like it was a review. Thanks to practical examples though, it helped solidify my understanding, and as well as clear up some ideas such as the poin of the projection matrix. I did have an understanding that it culled unused vertices, however for some reason I never connected it to the frustum of a camera until i saw the orthographic projection. The main part of this chapter was the hands on and practical examples of using matrices, and the approach to be taken to create and differentiate the multiple objects in a scene.
