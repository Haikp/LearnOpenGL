Taking a look at textures, we can see that there is a pattern when it comes to how objects are initialized and used. In a similar manner to buffers and objects, first we must allocate space for the texture by creating an unsigned int to serve as a reference for the texture, and allocating space by calling glGenTextures. Following the structure, we then bind the correct object to guarantee that we are interacting with the correct object. From here, we can begin inserting the texture we want, by calling stbi_load(). An important concept to understand is the extension of the image and what is allowed to support. Extension PNG for instance supports transparent values, as such we must define the texture as such by establishing that its internal format is RGBA, and not ust RGB. Not so similarly, JPG extensions do not always support transparent values, however setting the internal format to RGBA will not cause any inherent troubles according to my small test. After successfully importing the texture, we may set parameters or settings for the image, defining how it'll interact with objects that has space larger than the defined texture coordinates, and also to a degree, define the level of detail from a distance and how the texture will be rendered from a mipmap. Lastly, if there are multiple textures being used, then they must be appropriately binded and set in a uniform. AS A NOTE: DO THIS AFTER IMPORTING ALL YOUR IMAGES.
