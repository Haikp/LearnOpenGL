This module brings to light how OpenGL determines which pixels should be in front. This seems to be more of a module that brings awareness to the functionality behind camera frustums. FragCoords represent the screen that we see, with its x and y values representing the coordinates mapped on to our window linearly. These values are calculated through the MVP matrix being applied to the objects and camera frustum respectively. Along with that, we also receive the z proponent through the same calculations, however it is important to note that unlike the other proponents, z is not linear. This is due to the way that the objects are warped to fit on to screen space, effectively squishing the object onto the tip of a pyramid. As z is on the axis that gets warped in the procedure, the z values are not linear.

When it comes to moving from view space to clip space, it is important to note about precision. Imagining a pyramid starting from the base, as it goes up to the tip, the square base gets compressed. The more compressed the square gets, the less precise our view will be. This can cause some precision errors like z-fighting, where if two faces are layered and occupying the same space, then OpenGL will not be able to tell which face should be shown, and will flicker between the two. If there is a bit of space between the layers, then then can avoid some z-fighting. However if we lose enough precision, then despite there being a bit of space, z-fighting may happen. As such, a common method to avoid z-fighting is to increase the precision by moving the near plane further away from the camera and closer to the far plane of the frustum.
