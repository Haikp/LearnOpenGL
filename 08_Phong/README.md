Starting out, I'm not sure if I want to having 07_Lighting and 08_Phong be 2 different folders, but i'll update it along the way if I see that they should be combined.

More pressing matters, I want to vent my ideas about Phong shading here. As if writing this paragraph, I have not yet finished the module, but I want to be able to digest the first two out of three parts to Phong Shading. So, the three parts of Phong shading are ambience, diffusion, and specular lighting. Ambience in itself is straightforward, replicating the innate nature of light bouncing around and allowing shady areas to not be pitch black in real life. Essentially, take the color of the light, and scale it down as if the light isn't touching it, which in this example its by a factor of .1. In the case of diffusion, the initial math makes a lot of sense, which I was able to make my own informed decisions as to how this is done with dot products and normals, and it checks out that the prior studying I did paid off. The small road block I'm having currently is that I don't particularly understand the normal matrix, using the transpose and inverse function on the model matrix. I don't think that I can reason my way through this one just yet, so I'll take a look in to this normal matrix, and get back to it.
