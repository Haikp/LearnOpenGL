# Contents of this Branch
We are finally at the last module for the lighting section, which we bring all the lighting components together into one scene, and have multiple light sources affecting our objects. The module in itself was not difficult, as it was just refactoring the shaders and encapsulate each lighting technique into its own function. As usual, we compute the lighting, receive the ambient, diffuse, and specular value, and sum them together, outputting it through fragColor. The hardest part was remembering to normalize certain vectors, and naming variables appropriately. Aside from this, there wasn't much of new content to elaborate on.
