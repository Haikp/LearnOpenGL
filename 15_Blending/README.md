I wanted to get something as a contribution for the day, however I more or less contemplated my goals for the day, something feels off continuing to learning OpenGL at this point, rather I think its probably best to start nitpicking things to learn. I can't say for sure what exactly I want to do, but I feel committed to graphics programming at this point. I very much do feel much more confident in learning in dependently after conducting extensive research to really get an understanding of the previous topics, like depth, spot light effects, and camera movements. I think starting tomorrow, I'll take a break from LearnOpenGL.com, and start on a real project, and conduct research on my own if I need it. Of course learning these things fundamentals(?) are important as I'm sure that I'll use them eventually. How would I know what to look up if I don't know it exists in the first place. In all honesty, I'm definitely learning the wrong way, I need to make some projects on the side or else just learning the skill and doing nothing with it, I'm just going to forget it, but also I'm going to lose interest if I'm not stimulating my creativity.
