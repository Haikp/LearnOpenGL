This is one of the worst modules I have gone through. I get that theres a lot of black boxes behind the idea of how assimp parses data, and how the functions are written, but I believe I am partially at fault for not feeling to well at the moment. I have had bad experiences trying to run assimp in the past, so I decided to cheat a little bit to see if using the official code works, and sure enough it does. I'm going to try to dive deeper the same day I'm writing this. Just updating the README.md file as a progress check. I feel like this chapter shouldn't even be difficult to me. Sure there's some trust you need to have that the implementation files parse the data correctly, but I believe the general there should be enough to get a grasp of whats happening.
